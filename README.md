# React Localization Mini Project

This mini project demonstrates how to implement localization in a React app using the `react-i18next` library. The app includes a dropdown menu with different languages, allowing users to switch between them, dynamically changing the text on the website to match the selected language.

- Real-time language switching with dynamic content updates.
- Utilizes the `react-i18next` library for localization.
- Easily extensible for adding more languages and translations.

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Localization Setup

This project uses the `react-i18next` library for localization. You can find the translation files and configuration in the `src/i18n` directory. To add or modify translations, follow these steps:

1. Create a new JSON file for the desired language (e.g., `en.json` for English) in the `src/i18n/locales` directory.

2. Define your translations in the JSON file using the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "key1": "Translation for key1",
     "key2": "Translation for key2"
   }
   ```

3. Import and use the translation keys in your React components as shown in the code examples.

4. To switch languages, use the `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` in your components and set the desired language.

5. Don't forget to add new languages to the `i18n.js` configuration file.
